Medido care is an app that aims to bring health care closer to patients
The primary goal of our medical app is to enhance access to healthcare services for individuals in underserved communities. We aim to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers by providing a convenient platform where users can easily access medical information, schedule appointments with healthcare professionals, and receive virtual consultations.
